# GameOfLife

Implementation of 2D Conway's "Game Of Life" application for studying purpose.
The application is written using C++ and OpenGL Core for graphic development.

The project has two entry point:
- gameoflife.cpp: contains the main that runs the game.
- ex_main.cpp: contains the basic exercises to study OpenGL.

The resources where I've studied OpenGL are the following:
