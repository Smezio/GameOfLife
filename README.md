# GameOfLife

Implementation of 2D Conway's "Game Of Life" application for studying purpose.
The application is written using C++ and OpenGL Core for graphic development.

The game allows to set alive "meeples" (i.e., units in the board) at the beginning of the program; then the gameloop starts click on the button on the right side.

The graphic is elemental since I wanted to focused on the development of the game's mechanisms.

The project has two entry point:
- gameoflife.cpp: contains the main that runs the game.
- ex_main.cpp: contains the basic exercises to study OpenGL.

The resources where I've studied OpenGL are the following:
- LearnOpenGL | https://learnopengl.com/
- Songho.ca | https://www.songho.ca/opengl/index.html
